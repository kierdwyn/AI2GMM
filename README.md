### Demos on Synthetic Dataset

The folder `AI2GMM/scripts` contains several demo scripts for different application scenario:  

* `run_ixgmm.m`: Demo of run IGMM, I2GMM, AI2GMM for either clustering or non-exhaustive tasks on the synthetic dataset.
* `run_nonexhaustive.m`: Demo for non-exhaustive learning experiments on the synthetic dataset.
* `run_i2gmm_or_ai2gmm_classifier.m`: Demo of using I2GMM or AI2GMM as a classifier on a synthetic dataset.
* `run_igmm_classifier.m`: Demo of using IGMM as a classifier on a synthetic dataset.
